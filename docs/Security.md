# Security

OTP's built-in Grizzly web server is configured to accept HTTPS connections on port 8081 by default,
but the HTTPS listener needs an encryption key to establish a connection. The key is placed in a "
keystore", a format specific to Java server environments.

## Creating a keystore

By default, OTP will look for the keystore at `/var/otp/keystore`. To generate a self-signed key for
testing, use the command:

    keytool -genkey -keystore /var/otp/keystore -alias OTPServerKey

The alias of the key is arbitrary, but it's best to supply one that indicates the purpose of the key
to override the default. `keytool` will ask you a series of questions about you and your
organization; again, any values will do when creating this self-signed test key. `keytool` will also
ask you for a password to protect your keystore and key. This password will eventually be
configurable, but for now it is hard-coded into the OTP server, so you must set the keystore and key
passwords both to `opentrip`.

Of course with a self-signed key, most clients will (rightfully) refuse to connect without special
permission from the user. You'll need to add a security exception to most web browsers, or add
the `--insecure` switch when using CURL. You could theoretically buy and install a "real" trusted
SSL/TLS certificate it in the keystore using `keytool -gencert`, but since none of the functionality
protected by this encryption is public-facing a self-signed key should be sufficient for most use
cases. All connections to these API methods should be from trusted parties who can verify the
validity of the key with you directly as needed.

## Testing

Once you have created a key, start up the OTP server and test that HTTPS access and authentication
are possible. You should also be able to fetch any OTP resources over HTTPS. For example, you could
simply open `https://localhost:8081/index.html` in a browser, or open a raw TLS connection
using `openssl s_client -connect localhost:8081`, then issue the request `GET index.html HTTP/1.1`.
