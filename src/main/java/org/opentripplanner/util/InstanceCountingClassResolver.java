/**
 * This class is used for configuring and optimizing Kryo configuration. Kryo lets you register
 * specific serializers for specific concrete classes, but also has quite a few built-in default
 * serializers for individual classes or trees of classes under some interface (e.g. Collection).
 * Writing and registering a custom serializer or choosing between a third party class's built-in
 * Externalizable method and such a custom serializer, can have significant effects on the speed of
 * serialization and size of the resulting serialized data. In order to apply the 80/20 rule it's
 * helpful to have a list of how often various classes are serialized in your application.
 * <p>
 * This class works by wrapping one method in the Kryo framework that is called for every serialized
 * instance: the method that looks up the serializer for a given class. It counts how many times
 * each class is looked up, and can print out a summary of those frequencies as well as the
 * serializer that was associated with each class.
 * <p>
 * Note that if you have already registered serializers that are non-recursive, e.g. they write out
 * all the values in an internal int array within an ArrayList implementation, those internal fields
 * will of course not be counted.
 * <p>
 * We could achieve the same thing by extending the ReferenceResolver in the same way, but here in
 * ClassResolver we have easy access to the map of Class-Serializer associations.
 * <p>
 * To use this you need to specify a custom class resolver when creating Kryo: Kryo kryo = new
 * Kryo(new InstanceCountingClassResolver(), new MapReferenceResolver(), new
 * DefaultStreamFactory()); kryo.setRegistrationRequired(false); [...]
 * ((InstanceCountingClassResolver)kryo.getClassResolver()).summarize();
