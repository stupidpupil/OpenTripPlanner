## Overview

OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is an open source multi-modal trip planner, focusing on travel by scheduled
public transportation in combination with bicycling, walking, and mobility services including bike
share and ride hailing. Its server component runs on any platform with a Java virtual machine (
including Linux, Mac, and Windows). It exposes REST and GraphQL APIs that can be accessed by various
clients including open source Javascript components and native mobile applications. It builds its
representation of the transportation network from open data in open standard file formats (primarily
GTFS and OpenStreetMap). It applies real-time updates and alerts with immediate visibility to
clients, finding itineraries that account for disruptions and service changes.

Note that this branch contains **OpenTripPlanner 2**, the second major version of OTP, which has
been under development since Q2 2018. The latest version of OTP is v2.1.0, released in March 2022.

If you do not want to test or explore this version, please switch to the final 1.x release
tag `v1.5.0` or the `dev-1.x` branch for any patches and bugfixes applied to the v1.5.0 release.

## Performance Test

[ðŸ“Š Speed Benchmark](https://otp-performance.leonard.io/) We run the SpeedTest (included in the
code) to measure the performance for every PR merged into OTP. The test uses a fixed Norwegian Netex
data set and Grafana is used to display the results. Each run is listed under
the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/actions/workflows/performance-test.yml)
. If you need to run the test locally you
can [download the NeTex file](https://leonard.io/otp/rb_norway-aggregated-netex-2021-12-11.zip) from
the Continuous Integration Pipeline. There is
a [text file](test/ci-performance-test/travelSearch-expected-results.csv) with the expected results
which might need to be updated when OTP is changed and the test fails. The OSM data used is
the [norway-210101.osm.pbf](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/norway-210101.osm.pbf) file from
Geofabrik OSM extract from January 1st 2021.

## Repository layout

The main Java server code is in `src/main/`. OTP also includes a Javascript client based on the
Leaflet mapping library in `src/client/`. This client is now primarily used for testing, with most
major deployments building custom clients from reusable components. The Maven build produces a
unified ("shaded") JAR file at `target/otp-VERSION.jar` containing all necessary code and
dependencies to run OpenTripPlanner.

Additional information and instructions are available in
the [main documentation](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/), including a

OpenTripPlanner is a collaborative project incorporating code, translation, and documentation from
contributors around the world. We welcome new contributions.
Further [development guidelines](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/Developers-Guide/) can be
found in the documentation.

### Development history

The OpenTripPlanner project was launched by Portland, Oregon's transport agency
TriMet (http://trimet.org/) in July of 2009. As of this writing in Q3 2020, it has been in
development for over ten years. See the main documentation for an overview
of [OTP history](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/History/) and a list
of [cities and regions using OTP](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/Deployments/) around
the world.

## Mailing Lists

The main forums through which the OpenTripPlanner community organizes development and provides
mutual assistance are our two Google discussion groups. Changes and extensions to OTP are debated on
the [opentripplanner-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentripplanner-dev) developers'
list. More general questions and announcements of interest to non-developer OTP users should be
directed to
the [opentripplanner-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentripplanner-users) list.
Other details of [project governance](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/dev-2.x/Governance/) can be
found in the main documentation.
